# Introduction

Cyclistic is a Chicago-based bike-share company that provides affordable and eco-friendly travel options for both **urban commuters** and **leisure riders**.  

The aim of this case study is to explore the **usage patterns** of Cyclistic’s bikes, understand **differences between casual and member riders**, and provide **data-driven recommendations** to improve marketing strategies and operational efficiency.

We’ll explore:
- Differences between **members** and **casual riders**
- **When** and **how long** people ride
- Seasonal and hourly usage trends
- Predictive insights and business recommendations

# Installing and Loading Packages

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

```{r install-load}
# Install and load required packages
pkgs <- c("tidyverse", "lubridate", "janitor", "scales", "readr", 
          "ggplot2", "ggcorrplot", "effsize", "Metrics", "viridis", "ggpmisc")

new_pkgs <- pkgs[!(pkgs %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"])]
if(length(new_pkgs)) install.packages(new_pkgs)

lapply(pkgs, library, character.only = TRUE)
```

**Insight:**  
We load essential R packages for data manipulation (`tidyverse`), time handling (`lubridate`), visualization (`ggplot2`, `viridis`), cleaning (`janitor`), and statistical analysis (`effsize`, `Metrics`).

# Data Loading and Cleaning

```{r load-clean}
# Load cleaned data
file_path <- "C:/Users/ranji/OneDrive/Documents/cyclistic_case_study_project/cyclistic_cleaned.csv"

df <- read_csv(file_path, show_col_types = FALSE) %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    start_time = dmy_hm(start_time),
    end_time = dmy_hm(end_time),
    tripduration_min = as.numeric(tripduration_min)
  ) %>%
  distinct(trip_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  filter(!is.na(start_time) & !is.na(end_time) & !is.na(usertype)) %>%
  mutate(duration_min_calc = as.numeric(difftime(end_time, start_time, units = "mins"))) %>%
  filter(duration_min_calc > 0) %>%
  mutate(tripduration_min = duration_min_calc) %>%
  select(-duration_min_calc)
```

**Insight:**  
We ensure each ride is unique and valid — removing duplicates, empty values, and negative durations. This step ensures **data accuracy** for further analysis.

# Feature Engineering

```{r features}
df <- df %>%
  mutate(
    date = as.Date(start_time),
    hour = hour(start_time),
    month = month(start_time, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE),
    weekday = wday(start_time, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE),
    ride_length_category = case_when(
      tripduration_min <= 5 ~ "Very Short",
      tripduration_min > 5 & tripduration_min <= 15 ~ "Short",
      tripduration_min > 15 & tripduration_min <= 30 ~ "Medium",
      tripduration_min > 30 ~ "Long",
      TRUE ~ "UNKNOWN"
    )
  )
```

**Insight:**  
We add new variables such as **hour**, **month**, **weekday**, and **ride length category**.  
This helps analyze **temporal trends** and **ride behavior patterns**.

# Exploratory Data Overview

```{r summary}
df %>%
  summarise(
    total_rides = n(),
    avg_duration_min = mean(tripduration_min, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_duration_min = median(tripduration_min, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_duration_min = sd(tripduration_min, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

**Insight:**  
Cyclistic has a **large number of short trips**, with average duration around 15–20 minutes.  
The high standard deviation shows **some very long rides** are pulling up the mean.

---

# Ride Counts by User Type

```{r user-type}
df %>%
  group_by(usertype) %>%
  summarise(
    total_rides = n(),
    avg_duration = mean(tripduration_min, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_duration = median(tripduration_min, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

**Insight:**  
- **Members:** more frequent but shorter rides (daily commuters)  
- **Casual riders:** fewer but longer rides (leisure/tourism usage)

---

# Average Ride Duration by Weekday

```{r duration-weekday, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
df %>%
  group_by(weekday) %>%
  summarise(avg_duration = mean(tripduration_min, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = avg_duration, fill = weekday)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Average Ride Duration by Weekday",
       x = "Day of Week", y = "Average Duration (minutes)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Insight:**  
Rides are **longer on weekends**, suggesting that **casual riders dominate leisure days** while members use bikes mainly during the **workweek**.

---

# Ride Volume by Hour of the Day

```{r volume-hour, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
df %>%
  group_by(hour) %>%
  summarise(total_rides = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = total_rides)) +
  geom_line(color = "steelblue", linewidth = 1.2) +
  geom_point(color = "darkorange", size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Ride Volume by Hour of Day",
       x = "Hour (0–23)", y = "Total Rides") +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Insight:**  
Peak usage occurs at **8 AM** and **5–6 PM**, typical of **commuter behavior** among members.  
Casual riders show activity around **midday and evenings**.

---

# Average Ride Duration by User Type

```{r duration-usertype, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
df %>%
  group_by(usertype) %>%
  summarise(avg_duration = mean(tripduration_min, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = usertype, y = avg_duration, fill = usertype)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Average Ride Duration by User Type",
       x = "User Type", y = "Average Duration (Minutes)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Insight:**  
Casual users take rides that are **on average twice as long** as those by members — confirming different motivations (recreation vs commute).

---

# Ride Length Distribution

```{r ride-length, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
df %>%
  group_by(ride_length_category) %>%
  summarise(total_rides = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ride_length_category, y = total_rides, fill = ride_length_category)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Rides by Length Category",
       x = "Ride Length Category", y = "Number of Rides") +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Insight:**  
Over **70% of rides are short (under 15 minutes)**.  
This suggests a high number of **short-distance commutes**, ideal for **subscription or membership marketing**.

---

# Statistical Test: Comparing Members vs Casual Riders

```{r ttest}
t_test_result <- t.test(tripduration_min ~ usertype, data = df, var.equal = FALSE)
t_test_result
cohen.d(tripduration_min ~ usertype, data = df)
```

**Insight:**  
There’s a **significant difference** between the ride durations of members and casual riders.  
The **effect size (Cohen’s d)** is moderate, confirming real behavioral differences between groups.

---

# Correlation Analysis

```{r correlation, fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
numeric_df <- df %>% select_if(is.numeric)
cor_matrix <- cor(numeric_df, use = "complete.obs")
ggcorrplot(cor_matrix, lab = TRUE, colors = c("red", "white", "blue"))
```

**Insight:**  
Ride duration has a mild correlation with **hour of the day** and **day of week** — indicating consistent temporal usage patterns.

---

# Regression Analysis: Predicting Ride Duration

```{r regression, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
set.seed(42)
df_sample <- df %>% sample_n(5000)

model <- lm(tripduration_min ~ hour, data = df_sample)
summary(model)

ggplot(df_sample, aes(x = hour, y = tripduration_min)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "orange") +
  labs(title = "Ride Duration vs Hour of Start Time",
       subtitle = "Linear Regression with Confidence Interval",
       x = "Hour of Day", y = "Ride Duration (Minutes)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Insight:**  
While time of day has only a **weak effect** on ride duration, there’s a small upward trend during midday — matching casual usage hours.

# Model Diagnostics and Evaluation

```{r model-eval, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
set.seed(42)
df_sample <- df %>% sample_n(10000)

model_multi <- lm(tripduration_min ~ hour + weekday + usertype, data = df_sample)
df_sample$predicted <- predict(model_multi)

ggplot(df_sample, aes(x = predicted, y = tripduration_min)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.3, color="darkblue") +
  geom_abline(slope=1, intercept=0, color="red", linetype="dashed") +
  labs(title="Actual vs Predicted Ride Duration",
       x="Predicted Duration (Minutes)", y="Actual Duration (Minutes)") +
  theme_minimal()

rmse_val <- rmse(df_sample$tripduration_min, df_sample$predicted)
mae_val <- mae(df_sample$tripduration_min, df_sample$predicted)
cat("RMSE:", rmse_val, "\nMAE:", mae_val)
```

**Insight:**  
The model performs moderately, suggesting that while temporal and user-type factors influence ride duration, **other variables (e.g., location, weather)** could further improve predictions.
